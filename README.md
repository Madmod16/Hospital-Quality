This project involves the development of R functions for analyzing hospital performance data. The functions aim to provide insights into 30-day mortality rates for specified outcomes, identify top-performing hospitals in a state based on a user-specified ranking, and generate a 2-column data frame containing hospitals and their rankings in each state.
